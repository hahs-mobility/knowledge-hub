## What is AutoSSH?

AutoSSH is a program to start a copy of SSH and monitor it, restarting it as necessary should it die or stop passing traffic. It's particularly useful for maintaining persistent SSH tunnels and port forwarding connections.

### Key Benefits

- **Persistent Connections**: Automatically restarts SSH connections if they fail
- **Port Forwarding**: Create secure tunnels for accessing remote services
- **Monitoring**: Built-in connection monitoring and health checks
- **Reliability**: Handles network interruptions gracefully

### Common Use Cases

- Access internal services through a bastion host
- Secure database connections
- Remote development environments
- Bypassing network restrictions securely
